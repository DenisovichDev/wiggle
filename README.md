Made for @sableRaph and his ridiculous community.

# How to run 
- Clone this repo to your machine
- Make sure you are in a Linux/Unix environment (For Windows, use WSL)
- Make sure you have the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) and GNU Make Utility (make) installed
- To compile the project, use the command `make`.
- If you don't have `make`, don't worry. Use this command: 
```sh
$ gcc -Wall -g main.c bmp.c render.c -lm
``` 
- Execute the binary that was generated. It usually would be `a.out`:
```sh
$ ./a.out
```
- To stop, `Ctrl + C`

## Funny Comments Like Jeremy
This took 2 weeks to make. Not because it was super hard or anything, it's just that I am just too lazy. I started this when the topic was "RaphaÃ«l de Courville, Processing Community Lead Fellow". Then I started to think about making it Rain, since that was the topic for next week. Now this.

I shall add more comments later.
